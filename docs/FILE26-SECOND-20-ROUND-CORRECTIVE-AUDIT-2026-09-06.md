# File 26 — Second Independent 20-Round Corrective Audit — 2026-09-06

## Governing method

Baseline SHA: `90f5e7e2502e6516d2d2009b89cac33ded2b4916`.
Review branch: `codex/file26-second-20-round-review-20260906`.

Each round follows **Review → Ledger Freeze → Fix → Regression → Exact-head CI → Next Round**. No active-round defect is corrected before that round's review is complete and its ledger is frozen.

This second cycle does not reuse the prior 20 rounds as completion evidence. It starts from the fully corrected prior-cycle exact head and independently re-reviews the repository.

Repository/source/package evidence is separate from staging/live deployment, deployed database/schema, real owner connectors, browser evidence and operational behavior.

## Round ledger

| Round | Result | Frozen findings | Corrective closure |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | CLEAN | Deterministic package build, source/package manifest parity, path safety, immutable workflow action pins, PHP 7.4/8.3 matrix, artifact generation and release/source separation are internally consistent. No new proven defect. | No production change. Exact-head CI GREEN `ef41d8337fc84ee9fab35e27bb4df22153299337`. |
| 2 | DEFECT | `Schema_Integrity` verifies only column names and index names. It does not verify safety-critical column data types/nullability or index uniqueness/column order, so a physically incompatible schema can still be reported complete when names survive drift. | Pending correction after this frozen ledger. |

## Round status

- Completed reviews: **2/20**
- Defect rounds: **2**
- Clean rounds: **1**

Round 3 must not begin until Round 2 correction, regression and exact-head CI are green.
